## Background and Goals

I am a software developer with an interest in UI development and usability. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies in order to expand my knowledge and I believe that responsive, intuitive products that meet expectations are an essential element in everyone's life.

I strive to enrich my technical skills, be a capable worker and most importantly, gain the satisfaction that my creativity and competency help the company achieve its goals. In my free time I enjoy gaming and reading, mostly on IT subjects.


## Experience

###Software Developer, Betradar (Sportradar), Trondheim, Norway
#####April 2010 – Present (~3.5 years)

For the last year and a half I have been leading a small team in designing and developing 2 major front-end applications written in ActionScript 3 and Flex that communicate with a Java backend. One is a desktop Adobe AIR interface used by our internal operators for covering sport matches, the second one is a web Flex app that our customers use for monitoring live and historical sports matches. This has given me the challenge of making technical decisions, managing responsibilities within our team and communicating with the project owners in order to enhance usability of our products.

Though lately I have been mainly coding in ActionScript 3, I still work, as I have done at the beginning, on various backend and front-end tasks in other projects that I have been involved in, in Java and PHP/Javascript. Because of my interest in UI development and of my people skills, I have switched to almost full time front-end development.

###Java Developer at DataPro, Ålesund, Norway
#####January 2010 – April 2010 (3 months)

As part of a small team, I had the opportunity to make design and implementation decisions in order to transform the legacy code for a logistics system into a new, optimized J2EE application, offering a user-friendly interface for our clients. 

This position gave me insight into how warehouse software is organized and helped me develop my web skills. Also it offered me the opportunity to be an interviewer and decide, together with my team mates, what programming background is needed for future employees, which I believe played a role in developing my people skills.

###Java Developer at COMODO Romania, Iasi, Romania
#####March 2009 – August 2009 (6 months)

I have actively taken part in the design and the development of one of Internet security company Comodo's smaller projects, a live PC support desktop client. As a computer maintenance suite, it consisted of a rather complex framework: two desktop clients,  server support and a web administration console. My main work was on the Swing-based module used in production by our technical support engineers and I also wrote a small part of the web administration interface (Java and Wicket).

###Research of Java Web Services Frameworks                                           
#####in collaboration with SYNYGY Inc.,  2008-2009 (1 year)

As part of the experience that introduced me to enterprise software development, I analyzed the 3 mostly used Java web services frameworks at the time: Apache Axis 2, Apache CXF and Glassfish Metro, while comparing WS-specifications and performance. The study case involved using secure, reliable, and responsive web services and a client-server architecture that created a mechanism for booking hotel rooms. The main gain from this was getting in touch with tools such as Spring, Hibernate, JSF, PostgreSQL, Metro and Apache CXF, as well as learning good code practices from seniors in a big enterprise.


###Web Developer, SC AdWork Film S.R.L, Bucharest, Romania
#####2006-2008 (2 years)

* Designed, developed and maintained the website of Autoforumtv, an automobile TV show.
* Coordinated with the producer for major site changes.

###Web Developer, Freelancer
#####2005-2009 (3 years)

While studying computer science in high school and university, I have been involved in different freelancing projects, mainly in web programming. I have worked with PHP, MySQL, XML, JavaScript and JSF on web site projects mainly for non-profit organizations: the computer science student association of Iasi, chess Iasi county association, etc.

## Skills

I have been writing code, improving usability and experimenting with new software since 2005.

Most recently, the majority of code I have written has been in Actionscript and Java (with CSS and XML on the side), but I have experience in PHP and Javascript. I have developed my analytical thinking by studying C and C++ in high school and university, and I am familiar with a variety of other languages and frameworks, that I have tried in my free time: Python (and Django), web frameworks (Wicket, Play, JSF), Javascript frameworks (JQuery, DOJO).

I am used to working within a Scrum/Agile environment and enthusiastic about it. I have used SVN and GIT for versioning systems, and my OS proficiency extends to Windows, Mac OSX and Linux(mainly Ubuntu).
